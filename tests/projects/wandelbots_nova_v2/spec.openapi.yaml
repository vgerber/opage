        The default link chain includes link shapes only. It does not include any attached components like wire feeders or sensors.

        Attach additional shapes to the link reference frames by extending the link dictionaries before further use.
        Additional shapes may overlap each other per link and may also overlap the respective link's default shape.

        Sets the robot controller into freedrive mode and stays in freedrive until the websocket connection is closed by the client.
        In freedrive mode, it is possible to move the attached motion groups by hand.
        This is a blocking call. As long as the websocket connection is open, no other endpoint can control or move the robot.

        <!-- theme: danger -->

        > - The robot is in a safe state,
        > - The right payload is set,
        > - No humans or object are within the robot's reach or within the cell.

        As long as the websocket connection is open you will get the current state of the robot system in the response in the specified `response_rate`.
        If the activation failed, the returned status will return possible reasons for the failure.

        Free drive mode is only available for robot controllers that support it, in particular cobots.
        Use [listRobotControllers](listRobotControllers) to check if the robot controller supports free drive mode.

        Wait until an input/output reaches a certain value.

        This call returns as soon as the condition is met or the request fails.

        The `comparison_type` value is used to define how the current value of the input/output is compared with given value.
        Only set the value that corresponds to the `value_type` of the input/output.
        See [listIODescriptions](listIODescriptions) for more information.

        **Examples**

        1. Wait until analog input `AI_1` < 10:
            ```
            io: "AI_1"
            comparison_type: "COMPARISON_LESS"
            value: 10
            ```

        2. Wait until analog input `AI_2` > 5.0:

      description: |
        Switch between monitor and control usage as default for a robot controller.

        Monitoring mode is used to read information from the robot controller and control mode is used to command the robot system.
        As long as the robot controller is connected via network, monitoring mode is always possible.

        To switch to control mode
        the robot controller must be in `automatic` or `manual` operating mode and safety state `normal` or `reduced`. If the robot controller is in `manual` operating mode,
        you have to manually confirm the control usage activation on the robot control panel. This manual confirmation can't be replaced with this API.
        Without manual confirmation the robot controller will stay in monitor mode.

        The robot system will try to activate the required operation mode for the requested usage unless no active call requires a different mode.

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > `setDefaultMode` enables the robot controller to stay in control mode to keep the motors activated.
        > This allows for faster execution of sequential movements as no mode switches are required.

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > Some robot controllers prevent the external activation of automatic operating mode. In this case, changing the operating mode manually at the robot controller is mandatory.

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > The current operation mode and safety state can be requested via [getCurrentRobotControllerState](getCurrentRobotControllerState).

      description: |
        Plans a collision-free trajectory for a single motion group using point-to-point (PTP) motions.

        This endpoint is specifically designed for collision-free path planning algorithms that find
        a trajectory from a start joint position to a target position while avoiding obstacles.

        Use the following workflow to execute a planned collision-free trajectory:
        1. Plan a collision-free trajectory.
        2. Optional: Load the planned trajectory into the cache using the [addTrajectory](addTrajectory) endpoint.
        3. Execute the (cached) trajectory using the [executeTrajectory](executeTrajectory) endpoint.

        If the trajectory planning fails due to collision or algorithm constraints, the response
        will contain error information about the failure.

        > #### NOTE
        >
        > Using the trajectory cache is an optional performance optimization. It is not necessary to use the cache to execute trajectories.

        The response contains the result of the validation of the trajectory.

        Validation can lead to three different results:
        - Fully valid: The whole trajectory can be executed from start to end. The response will contain an unique identifier which is used to move the robot.
        - Partially valid: Only parts of the trajectory can be executed. The response will contain an unique identifier to move the robot
          and information about the failure for the part that is not executable.
        - Invalid: The trajectory can not be executed. The response will tell you the reason of failure.

        If the trajectory is at least partially valid, the parts of the trajectory that are valid can be executed using the [executeTrajectory](executeTrajectory) endpoint.

        The workflow is as follows:
          - Generate a trajectory with [planTrajectory](planTrajectory) or your own motion planner,
          - Send the trajectory to this endpoint to validate it and get a unique identifier for it,
          - The unique identifier will appear in the list of available trajectories, see [listTrajectories](listTrajectories) endpoint, if it is at least partially executable.
          - Execute your trajectory using the [executeTrajectory](executeTrajectory) endpoint.

        <!-- theme: success -->

        > Websocket endpoint

        Provides execution control over a previously [planned trajectory](planTrajectory). Enables the caller to attach input/output actions to the trajectory.

        ### Movement behavior

        | Virtual controller | Physical controller |
        |------------------|-------------------|
        | Desired joint configurations are commanded to each motion group and **applied immediately** | Move to desired **actual joint configuration**, **if possible** |

        ### Concept of location

          - The location or path parameter specifies the exact position along a trajectory.
          - The location is a scalar value that ranges from 0 to `n`, where `n` denotes the number of motion commands, or trajectory segments, e.g., line, p2p, etc. See [planTrajectory](planTrajectory).
          - Each integer value of the location corresponds to one motion command, e.g., 3.0 to 3.999 could be a line.

        ### Preconditions

        - The motion group's control mode is not claimed by any other endpoint.
        - The motion group's joint position are at start location specified with `InitializeMovementRequest`.
        - Use [executeToTrajectory](executeToTrajectory) to move the robot to the start location.

        ### Requests

        #### 1. Send `InitializeMovementRequest` to lock the trajectory to this connection
          The following actions are executed:
          - Sets robot controller mode to control mode,
          - Sets start location of the execution

          Keep in mind that only a single trajectory can be locked to a websocket connection at a time and not unlocked anymore.
          To execute another trajectory, a new connection must be established.

        #### 2. Send `StartMovementRequest` to start the movement

        Sets direction of movement, default is forward.

        #### **Optional**

        - To pause, send `PauseMovementRequest` before the movement has reached its end location.
        - Change the movement's velocity with `PlaybackSpeedRequest` after initializing the movement with `InitializeMovementRequest`.

        ### Responses

        - `InitializeMovementResponse` is sent to signal the success or failure of the `InitializeMovementRequest`.
        - Movement responses are streamed after a `StartMovementRequest` successfully started the movement.
          Movement responses are streamed in a rate that is defined as the multiple of the controller step-rate closest to
          but not exceeding the rate configured by `InitializeMovementRequest`.
        - Standstill response is sent once the movement has finished or has come to a standstill due to a pause.
        - `PauseMovementResponse` is sent to signal the success of the `PauseMovementRequest`. It does not signal the end of the movement.
          End of movement is signaled by Standstill response.
        - `PlaybackSpeedResponse` is sent to signal the success of the `PlaybackSpeedRequest`.
        - `MovementError` with error details is sent in case of an unexpected error, e.g., controller disconnects during movement.

        ### Tips and Tricks

        - A movement can be paused and resumed by sending `PauseMovementRequest` and `StartMovementRequest`.
        - Send `PlaybackSpeedRequest` before `StartMovementRequest` to reduce the velocity of the movement before it starts.
        - Send `PlaybackSpeedRequest` repeatedly to implement a slider. The velocity of the motion group can be adjusted with each controller step.
        Therefore, if your app needs a slider-like UI to alter the velocity of a currently running movement,
        you can send `PlaybackSpeedRequest` with different speed values repeatedly during the movement.
        - A closed trajectory (end and start joint position are equal) can be repeated by sending `StartMovementRequest` after the movement has finished.

      description: |
        <!-- theme: success -->

        > Websocket endpoint

        Provides execution control over a dynamically adaptable jogging motion for a motion group.

        Jogging describes controlling a motion group by sending real-time commands to move either its joints or the TCP.
        The commands contain target velocities that may change at any time during execution, so the resulting motion cannot be computed upfront.

        ### Preconditions

        The motion group is not moved by any other endpoint.

        ### Requests

        #### 1. Send `InitializeJoggingRequest` to configure the jogging.

        - Sets the robot controller mode to control mode.
        - Sets rate and coordinate system for the jogging response.

        #### 2. Send `JointVelocityRequest` or `TcpVelocityRequest` to start the jogging motion.

        #### 3. Change or stop the jogging motion

        - Change the jogging direction and/or velocity during the jogging motion with `JointVelocityRequest` or `TcpVelocityRequest`.
        - To stop the jogging motion, send zero velocities via either request.

        ### Responses

        - `InitializeJoggingResponse` is sent to signal the success or failure of the `InitializeJoggingRequest`.
        - Jogging responses are streamed continuously after an `InitializeJoggingRequest` is processed.
          Jogging responses contain the robot controller state and the state of the jogging control.
        - `JoggingErrorResponse` with error details is sent in case of an unexpected error, e.g., controller disconnects during jogging.

        ### Tips and Tricks

        - In the `JoggingResponse`, verify that the robot control is in the desired state, e.g., standstill, with JoggingState.
        - Ensure that the websocket connection remains open until the jogging motion is stopped to avoid unexpected stops.

            Robot is not able to perform the motion due to hard or soft restrictions.
            This can be due to a variety of reasons:

            - The robot is too close to a singularity,
            - The robot is too close to a joint limit,
            - Robot operating mode could not be set to the desired mode,
            - An operating mode change occurred during the motion.

        > Websocket endpoint

        Sends the **commanded** state, e.g., joint positions, velocities, accelerations, torques, for each motion group of the virtual controller
        and sets the joint configuration.

        Use [planTrajectory](planTrajectory) and [executeTrajectory](executeTrajectory) to move motion groups on virtual controllers.

        Learn more about the [movement behavior of virtual controllers in comparison to physical controllers](executeTrajectory#movement-behavior).

        > **NOTE**
        >
        > Incoming joint configurations are not visualized and their velocity limits are not checked.

        #### Use cases

        1. Creating a robotic application that dynamically adapts to the configured joints on the robot controller, using this stream to feed new joint configurations back to the motion groups.\
            The stream only sends data to the robot controller if a motion is executed.\
            If the robot controller's joint configuration differs too much from the incoming joint configuration, a following error occurs.
            Joint configurations that result in following errors are executed only for motions with a low velocity.

        2. Mimic freedrive motions.

      description: |
        Sets input/output variable configuration on the PROFINET device (i.e. NOVA's PROFINET service) from XML file.

        The inputs/outputs map variables to specific memory addresses in the process image.

        The default process image has buffer lengths of 64 bytes for input and output.
        - The size of the buffer is determined by the `config_file_content` that is passed in [addBusIOService](addBusIOService)
          and has to be in accordance with the GSDML file describing the PROFINET device.

        The PROFINET controller as well as NOVA's PROFINET service use an input/output variable configuration to interpret the bits of the input/output process image.
        - The NOVA's PROFINET service's configuration can be viewed via [listProfinetIOs](listProfinetIOs).

        For the PROFINET controller, e.g., a connected PLC, refer to the corresponding engineering system, e.g., TIA portal.

        #### Export variables
        You can export the variable configuration of the PROFINET controller as XML file from your engineering system, e.g., TIA portal.
        - The endpoint is built so that the perspective of input and output (PROFINET Device's input is PROFINET Controller's output)
          is internally handled (PROFINET device input is PROFINET controller output), meaning that you can paste the exported XML file here without modifying.

      description: |
        A link chain is a kinematic chain of links that is connected via joints.
        A motion group can be used to control the motion of the joints in a link chain.

        A link is a group of colliders that is attached to the link reference frame.

        The reference frame of a link is obtained after applying all sets of Denavit-Hartenberg-parameters from base to (including) the link index.

        This means that the reference frame of the link is on the rotation axis of the next joint in the kinematic chain.
        Example: For a motion group with 2 joints, the collider reference frame (CRF) for link 1 is on the rotation axis of joint 2. The chain looks like:

        ### MODE_CONTROLLER_NOT_CONFIGURED

        No controller with the specified identifier is configured. Call [addRobotController](addRobotController) to register a controller.

        ### MODE_INITIALIZING

        Indicates that a connection to the robot controller is established or reestablished in case of a disconnect.
        On success, the controller is set to MODE_MONITOR.
        On failure, the initialization process is retried until successful or cancelled by the user.

        ### MODE_MONITOR

        Read-only mode with an active controller connection.
        - Receives robot state and I/O signals
        - Move requests are rejected
        - No commands are sent to the controller

        ### MODE_CONTROL

        Active control mode.

        **Movement is possible in this mode**

        The robot is cyclically commanded to hold its current position.
        The robot state is received in sync with the controller cycle.
        Motion and jogging requests are accepted and executed.
        Input/Output interaction is enabled.

        ### MODE_FREE_DRIVE

        Read-only mode with servo motors enabled for manual movement (Free Drive).

        Move requests are rejected.

        Not supported by all robots: Use [getSupportedModes](getSupportedModes) to check Free Drive availability.

        To respect the safety zones of the controller and check for collision:
        1. Fetch the safety zones, link and tool shapes from the controller.
        2. Add the fetched zones, links and tools to a layer.
        3. Create other layers from your own 3D data as needed.
        4. Plan trajectory.
        5. The response highlights the layer in which a collision was detected by key.

      description: |
        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC
        This is the default behavior.
        The motion groups of the controller take commanded joint configuration as actual joint state.
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the virtual robot will act like a physical one, e.g., with a cycle time of 8ms to respond to a new joint state command.
        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC_NOT_COMPLY_WITH_CYCLETIME
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the robot will respond as fast as possible, limited only by software execution speed. Because of that the execution of a movement requires less time than with BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC.
        ## BEHAVIOR_EXTERNAL_SOURCE
        The external client is the only source of actual joint state changes.
        This mode is used to enable third party software indicating the current joint state via [externalJointsStream](externalJointsStream).

        An array of PROFINET slots.

        PROFINET models each device’s input/output hardware as a hierarchy of slots (modules) and subslots (submodules).
        A slot can represent a physical or virtual input/output card and each subslot one of its individual channels or functions.
        Every slot and subslot has unique identifiers that the controller uses to map cyclic input/output data and parameter records to its process image.
        This slot/subslot separation enables e.g., addressing each input/output stream when establishing input/output application relations (I/O-AR).
