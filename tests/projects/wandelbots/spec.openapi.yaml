      summary: Stream Free Drive Mode
      description: |-
        Sets the robot controller into freedrive mode and stays in freedrive until the websocket connection is closed by the client. In freedrive mode, it is possible to move the attached motion groups by hand. This is a blocking call. As long as the websocket connection is open, no other endpoint can control or move the robot.
        DANGER: Danger caused by robot. Improper assessment by the integrator of the application-specific hazards can result in people being crushed, drawn in or caught due to the robot's complex movement sequences. Before opening the websocket, ensure that
          - The robot is in a safe state,
          - The right payload is set (e.g by using the (getActivePayload)[getActivePayload] endpoint),
          - No humans or object are within the robot's reach or within the cell.

        As long as the websocket connection is open you will get the current state of the robot system in the response in the specified response_rate. If the activation failed, the returned status will return possible reasons for the failure.
        Free drive mode is only available for robot controllers that support it, in particular Collobarative Robots ("Cobots"). Use the (getSupportedModes)[getSupportedModes] endpoint to check if the robot controller supports free drive mode.

Only set the value that corresponds to the value_type of the I/O, see (listIODescriptions)[listIODescriptions] for more information. Examples: If you want to wait until an analog input ("AI_1") is less than 10, you would set io to "AI_1" comparison_type to COMPARISON_LESS and only integer_value to 10. If you want to wait until an analog input ("AI_2") is greater than 5.0, you would set io to "AI_2" comparison_type to COMPARISON_GREATER and only floating_value to 5.0. If you want to wait until a digital input ("DI_3") is true, you would set io to "DI_3" comparison_type to COMPARISON_EQUAL and only boolean_value to true.

      description: |
        Switch between monitor and control usage as default for a robot controller.
        Monitoring mode is used to read information from the robot controller and control mode is used to command the robot system.
        As long as the robot controller is connected via network monitoring mode is always possible. To switch to control mode
        the robot controller must be in `automatic` or `manual` operating mode. If the robot controller is in `manual` operating mode,
        you have manually confirm the control usage activation on the robot control panel. This manual confirmation can't be replaced with this API.
        Without manual confirmation the robot controller will stay in monitor mode.

        The robot system will try to activate the required operation mode for the requested usage unless no active call requires a different mode.
        Note: Some robot controllers prevent the external activation of automatic operating mode. In this case, changing the operating mode manually at the robot controller is mandatory.
        If a mode change is not possible, the response lists reasons for the failed change.

        Use parameter rotation_type to get the orientation part of the transformation offset of the coordinate system returned in the requested rotation angle type.
        If parameter rotation_type is not set, the orientation part of the transformation offset of the coordinate system is returned in the rotation angle type used on the robot controller.
        This can be useful for visualization purposes in the client application due to equivalent numbers with robot control panel visualization.

        The coordinate systems from the robot controller are loaded when the motion group associated with the coordinate system is activated.
        With deactivation of the motion group, the associated coordinate systems are removed from Nova. The unique identifier of the coordinate systems from the robot controllers
        are suffixed with "On" + the unique identifier of the robot controller.

        Updating the robot controller's configuration either requires credentials or is not possible. With the endpoint [addCoordinateSystem](addCoordinateSystem) you can create a
        coordinate system without changing the robot controller's configuration.

        Request a coordinate system specification for a given identifier.

        Use parameter rotation_type to get the orientation part of the transformation offset of the coordinate system returned in the requested rotation angle type.
        If parameter rotation_type is not set, the orientation part of the transformation offset of the coordinate system is returned in the rotation angle type used on the robot controller.
        This can be useful for visualization purposes in the client application due to equivalent numbers with robot control panel visualization.

        User coordinate systems can be configured on a robot controller during setup or added to the system via the [addCoordinateSystem](addCoordinateSystem) endpoint.

        Updating the robot controller's configuration either requires credentials or is not possible. With the endpoint [addCoordinateSystem](addCoordinateSystem) you can create a
        coordinate system without changing the robot controller's configuration.

        TIP: If the coordinate system has originally been configured on the robot controller, it will remain on the controller even after this endpoint
        has been executed successfully..

        This will remove the user coordinate system from the list of user coordinate systems but keep
        all dependent coordinate systems which use the deleted coordinate system as reference.
        Coordinate systems on the robot controller are not affected by this operation. They can be removed via the robot control panel only
        and will be removed in NOVA when the controller is removed. On virtual controllers, use the
        [deleteVirtualRobotCoordinateSystem](deleteVirtualRobotCoordinateSystem) endpoint to remove coordinate systems from NOVA and the virtual controller.

        All available coordinate systems can be listed via the [listCoordinateSystems](listCoordinateSystems) endpoint.

      summary: Stream Joints
      description: |
        Move one or more joints of a motion group with specified velocities via a websocket.

        The purpose of a joint jogging motion is to maneuver a motion group in one or more joints with a specified velocity for each joint.
        The sign of the velocity determines the direction of the joint movement. The velocity is given in [rad/s].
        In contrast to a planned motion, a jogging motion can be changed dynamically while the motion group is in motion.

        Only one single client at a time can jog a particular motion group.
        If another client tries to jog the same motion group at the same time, the second call will fail.

        The movement of the motion group will start as soon as:
        * the motion group is not in motion
        * the websocket connection is established
        * the first request has been sent

        As long as the jogging motion is ongoing, responses will be sent continuously and contain the current state of the motion group.
        The responses will be sent with the specified rate according to the *response_rate* parameter of the initial websocket request.
        While in motion, the desired joint velocity can be changed by sending a new request to the same websocket.
        The motion and sending of the replies will stop when:
        * a [stopJogging](stopJogging) request was received, processed, and the movement stopped
          Motion group state will be published in the original command stream until the motion group has fully stopped.
        * the client cancels the stream (not recommended, because final stopping position will not be returned from the stream)

        When a physical limit (e.g. joint limit) is reached, the motion group will stop moving in the desired direction.
        The stream, howewer, will continue to send the state until the client cancels the stream or sends the [stopJogging](stopJogging) request.

        **Usage example:**

        1. Open a websocket via python and start the jogging motion:
        ```bash
        > python -m websockets "ws://<IP of Wandelbots Nova API>/api/v1/cells/<your cell id>/motion-groups/move-joint"
        ```
        2. Send the following message to move with a velocity of 0.1 rad/s (negative) for joint 5 and 0.2 rad/s for joint 6:
        ```json
        {
          "motion_group": "<your motion group id>",
          "joint_velocities": [0, 0, 0, 0, -0.1, 0.2],
          "response_rate": 500
        }
        ```
        The provided NOVA API clients also natively support jogging motions, without the need to manually open a websocket.

        TIP:
        If the jogging movement is stopped immediately, ensure that
          - A websocket connection is established. Websockets can be kept open until the robot's movement is done as opposed to a simple HTTP GET request.
          - The motion group is not in motion by another jogging movement or a planned movement.

        TIP:
        If the robot does not move, ensure that
          - The joint velocity values are not zero,
          - The motion group is not in a state where it cannot move further (e.g. joint limit reached).

        TIP:
        If the specified velocities are higher than the maximum allowed by the robot controller, the motion group will move with the maximum allowed velocities.

        Move TCP along/around a specified direction vector with a specified velocity via a websocket.

        The purpose of a direction jogging motion is to move a device in exactly one direction with a specified maximum velocity.
        The sign of the velocity determines the direction of the movement: Positive [+] or Negative [-]. The velocity is given in [mm/s].
        In contrast to a planned motion, a jogging motion can be changed dynamically while the motion group is in motion.

        Only one single client at a time can jog a particular motion group.
        If another client tries to jog the same motion group at the same time, the second call will fail.

        The responses will be sent with the specified rate according to the *response_rate* parameter of the initial websocket request.
        While in motion, the desired direction and velocity can be changed by sending a new request to the same websocket.
        The motion and sending of the replies will stop when:
        * a [stopJogging](stopJogging) request was received, processed, and the movement stopped
          The motion group state will be published in the original command stream until the motion group has stopped.
        * the client cancels the stream (not recommended, because final stopping position will not be returned from the stream)

        When a physical limit (e.g. workspace boundary) is reached, the motion group will stop moving in the desired direction.
        The stream, howewer, will continue to send the state until the client cancels the stream or sends the [stopJogging](stopJogging) request.

        Singularities are avoided during a jogging motion. This avoidance can result in deviations from the specified direction. The amount of deviation depends on the robot type and current velocity.
        These mechanisms can lead to a small deviation from the specified direction. The size of deviation is depending on robot type and current velocity.

         **Usage example:**

        1. Open a websocket via python and start the jogging motion:
        ```bash
        > python -m websockets "ws://<IP of Wandelbots Nova API>/api/v1/cells/<your cell id>/motion-groups/move-tcp"
        ```
        2. Send the following message to the server to move current TCP 2 parts up in z direction and one part in negative y direction
        with 0.2 mm/s along the specified direction vector:
        ```json
        {
          "motion_group": "<your motion group id>",
          "position_direction": {
            "y": -0.5,
            "z": 1
          },
          "rotation_direction": {},
          "position_velocity": 0.2,
          "response_rate": 500
        }
        ```
        The NOVA API clients support jogging motions without the need to manually open a websocket.

      summary: Load Planned Motion
      description: |-
        Loads and validates the data of a planned motion into a motion session.
        The response contains information about the validated motion.

        Validation can lead to three different results:
        - Fully valid: The whole planned motion can be executed from start to end. The response will contain the session to move the robot.
        - Partially valid: Only parts of the planned motion can be executed. The response will contain the session to move the robot and information about the failure for the part that is not executable.
        - Invalid: The planned motion can not be executed. The response will tell you, which information about the reason of failure.

        If the motion is at least partially valid, the parts of the motion that are valid can be executed using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        You can use the following workflows:
          - Plan motions using the [planMotion](planMotion) endpoint,
          - Store the planned motion persistently,
          - Use this endpoint to reload the stored motion and get a motion session for it.
          - Execute the loaded motion using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        OR:
          - Generate a planned motion with [planTrajectory](planTrajectory) or your own motion planner,
          - Send the planned motion to this endpoint to validate it and get a motion session for it,
          - Execute your motion using the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

        Once a planned motion is validated, it is treated like a motion session and will appear in the list of available motions, see [listMotions](listMotions) endpoint.
        You can then execute a motion session with the [streamMoveForward](streamMoveForward) endpoint.

            Robot is not able to perform the motion due to hard or soft restrictions.
            This can be due to a variety of reasons:

            - The robot is too close to a singularity,
            - The robot is too close to a joint limit,
            - Robot operating mode could not be set to the desired mode,

      description: |
        Execute a program in Wandelscript. The Wandelscript can also move multiple robots by using the 'do with' syntax.

        The execute operation will be started from the current joint configuration of any addressed robot(s).

        Addressed robots have to be in control mode for the execute operation to succeed.

        A request to this endpoint will block this endpoint until the program has been executed, or until an error occurs.

        The executed movement is returned in case of a succesful execution.
        Otherwise an error (e.g. out of reach, singularity), is returned.

        The Wandelscript can either be submitted as is, using Content-type text/plain,
        or as content-type application/json with the Wandelscript under "code" alongside a set of values provided under "initial_state".

        The plan operation can be used to check if a Wandelscript is executable,

        If the Wandelscript is executable, the result contains the motion path.
        If the Wandelscript is not executable, e.g. points that are out of reach, or the joints encounter a singularity, the
        reason is returned.

      summary: Stream Joint Configuration
      description: |
        This stream provides the commanded joint state
        and sets a motion groups joint configuration, e.g. to move a motion group.
        The concept is that an application is using the Motion Service to move a motion group.
        The Motion Service is commanding the desired joint
        configuration of a motion group.

        Physical motion groups move to this joint configuration.

        With physical motion groups, this takes some time and only works if
        possible.

        And you have the *actual* joint state - the current real motion group
        configuration.

        Again, this stream is providing *commanded* joint state!
        It is __not__ providing the *actual* joint state!
        (Please file a request - if you need a stream of the *actual* joint state)

        When the virtual controller receives joint commands the joint configuration is immediately adapted to match the incoming joint configurations.
        CAUTION: Incoming joint configurations are not visualized and their velocity limits are not checked.
        we don't even check limits!

        Possible use cases are:
        1. Creating a robotic application that dynamically adapts to the configured joints on the robot controller, using this stream to feed
        new joint configurations back to the motion group.

        The stream only sends data to the robot controller if a motion is executed.

        If the robot controller's joint configuration differs too much from the incoming joint configuration, a following error occurs.
        Joint configurations that result in following errors are executed only for motions with a low velocity.

        2. Mimic Freedrive motions.
        DANGER: If the incoming joint configuration is set to maximum velocity, the movement to reach this incoming joint configuration
        will be executed with maximum speed regardless of safety zones and mechanical limits.

        Everything is slowed down by the same factor. Therefore, this should only be used for teaching and trajectory
        evaluation purposes. If the process requires a certain velocity, the respective limits should be set when planning the motion.
        This will not change the velocity override of the controller. The controller velocity override value shall be 100% to ensure
        controllability of the motion group.

        of data: error code, error message, and error details. You can find out more
        about this error model and how to work with it in the [API Design
        Guide](https://cloud.google.com/apis/design/errors).

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_UNDEFINED

        Indicates that the robot controller is currently performing a mode transition.

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_DISCONNECT

        There is no communication with the robot controller at all. All connections are closed.
        No command is sent to the robot controller while in this mode. No IO interaction is possible in this mode!
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode!

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_MONITOR

        A connection to the robot controller is established to only read the robot controller state.
        No command is sent to the robot controller while in this mode. It is possible to receive IO information.
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode!

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_CONTROL

        An active connection is established with the robot controller and the robot system is cyclic commanded
        to stay in its actual position. The robot controller state is received in the cycle time of the robot controller.
        Requests via the MotionService and JoggingService will be processed and executed in this mode.
        IO interaction is possible in this mode! **In this mode the robot system can be commanded to move.**

        ### ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_FREE_DRIVE

        Like ROBOT_SYSTEM_MODE_MONITOR a connection to the robot controller is established to only read the robot controller state.
        The difference is that the motion groups can be moved by the user (Free Drive). Thus, the servo motors are turned on.
        All move requests will be rejected in this mode! **This mode is not supported by every robot!**
        Use [getSupportedModes](getSupportedModes) to evaluate if the device support free drive.

        > axis = Vector[0:2]
        > angle = |axis| in [rad]
        > axis.normalized * angle

        **Euler notation**

            Blending alters the geometry of the TCP path at the target point of a motion command

        A link chain is a kinematic chain of links that is connected via joints.
        A motion group can be used to control the motion of the joints in a link chain.

        A link is a group of colliders that is attached to the link reference frame.

        The reference frame of a link is obtained after applying all sets of Denavit-Hartenberg-parameters from base to (including) the link index.

        This means that the reference frame of the link is on the rotation axis of the next joint in the kinematic chain.
        Example: For a motion group with 2 joints, the collider reference frame (CRF) for link 1 is on the rotation axis of joint 2. The chain looks like:
        - Origin >> Mounting >> Base >> (CRF Base) Joint 0 >> Link 0 >> (CRF Link 0) Joint 1 >> Link 1 >> (CRF Link 1) Flange (CRF Tool) >> TCP

        Adjacent links in the kinematic chain of the motion group are not checked for mutual collision.

        Use PTP motions if possible. They will almost never fail due to singularities (only if the target point is at a singularity).

        Configuration of a robot in the collision scene.

        Default link shapes are provided for all supported robots. Apply `use_default_link_shapes` with `true`.

        `link_attachements` are additional shapes that are attached to the link reference frames.
        The reference frame of the `link_attachements` is obtained after applying all sets of DH-parameters
        from base to (including) the specified index.
        Adjacent links in the kinematic chain of the robot are not checked for collision.

        The tool is treated like another link attached to the end (flange) of the chain.
        All tool shapes are described in the flange frame.

        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC
        This is the default behavior.
        The motion group instantly takes any commanded joint configuration as actual joint state.
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the virtual robot will act like a physical one, e.g. with a cycle time of 8ms to respond to a new joint state command.
        ## BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC_NOT_COMPLY_WITH_CYCLETIME
        Configures the compliance of the virtual robot with the normal ControllerState cycle time. If set, the robot will respond as fast as possible, limited only by software execution speed. Because of that the execution of a movement requires less time than with BEHAVIOR_AUTOMATIC.
        ## BEHAVIOR_EXTERNAL_SOURCE
        The external client is the only source of actual joint state changes.
        This mode is used to enable third party software indicating the current joint state via [externalJointsStream](externalJointsStream).

        Maps a Wandelbots Nova motion group to its configuration in the collision scene. Key must be a motion group identifier.

        Values are collision motion group objects.

        A collision motion group defines a motion group in the collision scene.

        The motion group is attached to the origin of the scene.
        To relocate the motion group, configure its mounting offset on the physical controller.
        This ensures that the definition of motion commands and collision scenes use the same coordinate system.
        The kinematic chain looks like this:
        - Origin >> Mounting >> Base >> Joint 0 >> Link 0 >> Joint 1 >> […] >> TCP

        A `tool` is treated like another link attached to the end (flange) of the kinematic chain.
        All tool colliders are described in the flange frame.

        Defines the collision scene.

        There are two types of objects in the scene:
        - `colliders`: Each collider is attached directly to the origin of the scene: Origin >> Collider
        - `motion-groups`: Each motion group is assigned a kinematic chain of links with a special collider, called tool, attached to the last element.
          The motion group is attached to the origin of the scene via its mounting: Origin >> Mounting >> Motion Group Base >> […]

      description: |
        Maps a Wandelbots Nova motion group to its assembly configuration in the collision scene. Key must be a motion group identifier.

        A collision motion group defines a motion group in the collision scene.

        The motion group is attached to the origin of the scene.
        To relocate the motion group, configure its mounting offset on the physical controller.
        This ensures that the definition of motion commands and collision scenes use the same coordinate system.
        The kinematic chain looks like this:
        - Origin >> Mounting >> Base >> Joint 0 >> Link 0 >> Joint 1 >> […] >> TCP

        A `tool` is treated like another link attached to the end (flange) of the kinematic chain.
        All tool colliders are described in the flange frame.

        There is one group for each of the following components:
        - Colliders attached to the origin of the scene,
        - Tool per motion group, and
        - For each link per motion group.

        The scene is assembled by adding components in the following order.
        1. stored_scenes
        2. scene
        3. stored_colliders
        4. colliders
